This program is recreating the first video game made, Pong. You control the left paddle.
You need to bounce the ball away from your side and prevent it from getting past you paddle.
The program controls the other paddle. You need to send the ball past their paddle.
As long as the ball has not passed any paddles, it will get faster and faster.

Press the up arrow key and the down arrow key on your keyboard to move your paddle.
