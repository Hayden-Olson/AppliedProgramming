# Overview

I wanted to learn how to use the arcade library in Python.

This game is BlackJack. Get as close as you can to a value of 21 as you can without going over!
You can choose to hit or hold. Hitting will get you more cards. Holding will be your final move as you cannot get more cards.
You begin with two cards. The dealer will also have two cards, though they have only one card revealed. You need to beat their hand.
Cards with a numeric value have a value equal to that. Face cards are all worth 10. The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 depending on what you need.
If you go over a value of 21, you bust and lose the round.

In this file, you grab cards from the middle deck if you want to hit. Once you are done, hit H to hold. Press R to restart.

This was practice for game development. Some day I hope to make my game idea come to life.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
